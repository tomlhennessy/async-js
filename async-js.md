# Threading

* Overview:
    - A program's birth (coding) is followed by its lifetime (execution), known byt its runtime

* Single-threaded vs Multi-threaded:
    Single-threaded:
        - Executes one command at a time
        - Analogous to a kitchen with one chef, where dishes are prepared sequentially
        - JavaScript operates on this model
    Multi-threaded:
        - Executes multiple commands simultaneously
        - Like a kitchen with several chefs working on different dishes

    JavaScript's Single-threaded nature:
        - Only one command runs at a time
        - Potential for unresponsiveness if a command takes too long
